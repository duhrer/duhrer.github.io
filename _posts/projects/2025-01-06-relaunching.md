It's been a while since I had a shared area where I posted stuff. I used to
have a Blogger account and used that for about five years, but haven't keep up
with it since my son was born.

I haven't stopped making things or writing, though. I often create detailed
markdown documentation for new projects. I also keep copious notes about my
projects in markdown format in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This year, I decided to share more of my writing and more of my experencies as a
way of helping me:

1. Reflect on and document what I'm doing in my project work.
2. Exchange ideas with people who are doing similar stuff.
3. Keep my older demos working.
4. Keep up my writing skills.
5. Keep up some of the web coding skills I'm not really exercising in other
   project work.
6. Document older work.

On that last note,for now I plan to just treat my notes as
one timeline and add anything I care to, dated around the time I worked on it.
If you find that confusing, don't worry, as there will be plenty of actual new
stuff as well, and I'll link to previous efforts when revisiting projects.

Stay tuned!

## The Tech Stuff

For those who care about the tech: After reading a bunch of blog posts,
articles, and forum posts, I decided to make better use of the
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) support [built into GitHub
Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll),
which I've already been using for years.

This time around, I'm using [beautiful
Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/tree/master). It has a
decent look and feel, and adds a basic search as well. It's highly configurable,
and I've been able to tailor it well to what I want so far. It's also a well
fleshed out example of how to make good use of Jekyll if I want to do things
differently later.

If you want more information, I keep working notes on how I deploy and manage
things [in the README](/README.md) for this repository.
