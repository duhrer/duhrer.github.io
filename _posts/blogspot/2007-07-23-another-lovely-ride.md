Elaine and I went out to Arnish after dinner:

We went out on the street, with some tough climbs, but some really fun downhill
segments as well. We ended up in Arnish right on schedule, although we didn't
find the route to the lighthouse our first time out. We did get a good view of
the town from across the bay.

We came back through the castle grounds, which was great as always. Turns out
the road from Arnish connects into one of my favorite parts of the grounds,
along the river and leading down to the bay. We came in sight of the bay just
in time to see the evening ferry docking from one of the higher overlooks, which
was very nice.

Next time, we'll have to go both ways through the castle grounds, and find
trails to the lighthouse and this stone structure we saw on one of the hills.
