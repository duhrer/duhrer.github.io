[Olaf
Stapledon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Stapledon) isn't afraid to work on a big canvas. His ["Star
Maker"](/2010-01-30-star-maker-by-olaf-stapledon) spans the life of our universe and beyond. Rather than searching for
power, or money, or fame, or even love, the main character in "Star Maker" roams
the universe trying to become aware enough to perceive and interact with a
higher power. It's a spiritual book in which the universe is revealed to be
both sublimely ordered and painfully uncaring. In this epic and amazing work,
the life of humanity is a but a single thread, a few paragraphs in the larger
story.

"Last and First Men" is more tightly focused, and follows the development of
humanity over the course of some three trillion years. It starts in our own
time, and moves forward slowly at first. As is inevitable, Stapledon's ideas
about the immediate future date the work, but once modern civilization is safely
past, the book hits its stride. Eighteen species of humanity come and go,
rising to meet the challenges presented by the universe around them (or
succumbing to them). Along the way, Stapledon explores ideas about longevity,
higher consciousness, the proper goals of a world society, and imagines that
larger patterns of rise and fall (for the world, for the species, for
intelligent life in our solar system) might lie far beyond our own history.

The focus of "Last and First Men" is societies, states, civilizations, and
species rather than individual lives. It's only toward the end that we learn
the history of the narrator and find the full spiritual center of the book.
"Star Maker" on the other hand, begins with the life of an individual and his
core quest, and draws us in from the beginning. The later book ("Star Maker")
seems more mature and complete as a result. I tend to pick lovingly worn
second-hand copies of books in used bookstores, which doesn't always lend itself
to reading things in the right order. In this case, I read "Star Maker" (the
sequel) some months before "Last and First Men". "Last and First Men" holds up
well, but if you get the chance, go through them in order, as the ideals of
"Last and First Men" are expanded and played out on an even grander stage in
"Star Maker". 

Both "Star Maker" and "Last and First Men" are highly recommended food for the
mind. If you find yourself getting a headache from the ultra-wide focus of both
books, you could do a lot worse than Larry Niven's "World Out of Time", in which
a single individual encounters the distant future (in two discrete chunks). I'd
also recommend "Forever Free", by Joe Haldeman, which pans out toward the end to
embrace some of the same scope, but keeps its focus more firmly on the
individual.

Yet again I'm indebted to the Sci-fi Masterworks series for broadening my
horizons to include Stapledon. Stay tuned for the few remaining installments
("Tau Zero" is coming with me on my next trip).
