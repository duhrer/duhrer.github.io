"Non-stop" is a classic of science fiction, and stands the test of time
amazingly well. Like "Learning the World" by Ken MacLeod, "Non-stop" deals with
a massive ship (and self-sustaining ecosystem) traveling between stars over the
course of generations. Unlike "Learning the World", the society of the ship
that is the focus of "Non-stop" has broken down in a fundamental way, devolving
in some ways, evolving in others.

One thing that  makes this book remarkable is how wonderfully constructed the
narrative is. The origins of society and of the inhabitants themselves are
revealed in a way that keeps the reader engrossed. The plot twists, and there
are many, all emerge naturally, and hold up to close scrutiny when rereading the
book. None of the twists or revelations seem cheap or contrived, which is
refreshing if you've seen one too many Hollywood blockbusters or episodic TV
series (I love "Heroes" and all, but seriously, the strain of having to come up
with the next plot twist that fits the prior narrative must be just exhausting).

Another thing that amazed me when leafing back through the book was just how
short each seminal section of the book turned out to be. The major revelations
seldom take more than a few paragraphs. It's as thought the economy of a
brilliant short story author (Borges, for example) were turned towards creating
a novel as a series of linear vignettes.  I'd imagine the work would have
worked well serialized, and I'm sure it also will fit the attention span of the
traveling reader as well.

At any rate, the book is a quick read (and reread), and is highly recommended.
I look forward to picking up Aldiss's history of Science Fiction as well as
further of his fiction works in the future.
