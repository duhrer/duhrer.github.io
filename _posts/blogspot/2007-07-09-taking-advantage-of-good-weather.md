I usually go for a longer run on Sunday. Yesterday was pretty crummy, colder
and a spitting rain. Today on the other hand, was nice and warm with just
enough of a breeze. I mapped out a longish route (8+ miles), but ended up only
doing about 80% of it. Still a good run ([see
the route here](http://www.mapmyrun.com/view_route?r=6f8e6222ec45c7614b727523f6b96471))...
