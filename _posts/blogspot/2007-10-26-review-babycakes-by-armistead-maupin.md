I picked up "Tales of the City" in the airport on my way to South Africa earlier
this year, devoured it, and picked up the next two books in the series ("More
Tales of the City" and "Further Tales of the City") for the trip back home to
Stornoway.

I loved the dialog, especialy in the early works. I often found myself laughing
out loud as I read, no matter the surroundings. The series is full of
characters and situations that are great fun to read. I do get the sense that
some of the characters are types rather than fully rounded, but it's the same as
any good comedy, where you have a core of characters you know and then a whole
host of bit players who act as foils for the core characters, allowing them new
ways to express themselves. Some of the convoluted plots (the Jonestown arc,
the Cannibal Cult), were a bit much, and distracted me to the point where I
didn't feel the need to pick up any further books in the series for a while.

On the cusp of an upcoming trip to Copenhagen, I went by the public library to
pick up some new reading material (I typically go through two or three books a
trip). Browsing through the shelves, I found the fourth and fifth volumes in
the series, "Babycakes" and "Significant Others". Just as half the popcorn
rarely lasts me through the previews, I finished "Babycakes" before the trip
even started.

What surprised me about this latest work was its change of tone. The Barbary
Lane in the fourth book is a bit more somber. There's still humor and life, but
the character of Mouse in particular is a bit wearier in a world that has moved
into the 1980s and is now all too intimately aware of AIDS. There were also a
few scene changes (Seattle, London) that allowed for a bit of good natured
cultural commentary. I particularly enjoyed the several characters who found
themselves traveling from the West Coast of the US to London, which resonates
slightly with my own experiences a bit farther North and a few decades later.

Anyway, it's a good read, but probably is best enjoyed if you work your way
through the earlier books. I have "Significant Others" with me and will likely
comment on that shortly.
