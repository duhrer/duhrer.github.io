Although I read little non fiction in general, one exception has been the work
of Oliver Sacks, whose writing I enjoy, and whose topics are almost always
entertaining and engaging. I picked up "The Man with a Shattered World" largely
because Sacks wrote the introduction, and because it sounded as though it would
be a nice companion to "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" and other works
already in my library.

I was not disappointed. "The Man with a Shattered World" is one of two
biographies published at the end of A. R. Luria's distinguished career as a
neuropsychologist. The book tells the story of Zazetsky, a soldier in the
Second World War whose brain injury instantly transformed him from a bright
young man on the verge of finishing his engineering degree to an illiterate
unable to perform any meaningful work or even hold a simple conversation. 

Zazetsky discovered that he was still able to write by rote (although reading
even his own writing was a tortuous process), and was able to chronicle his
injury and its effects. Although he never recovered as fully as he hoped,
Zazetsky struggled to improve himself in what ways he could and did make some
small progress. Given that he initially could not even recognize the Cyrillic
alphabet and at his best could barely read more than two words at a time, the
fact that he was able to write over 3,000 pages of journal entries over the
course of 30 years is as inspiring as the moon landing.

Between the numerous journal entries, Luria intersperses observations, brain
science, and other narrative details. He provides the structure that Zazetsky
himself could not, but with a light hand, so that the journal entries themselves
shine through. This combination of subjective detail (from Zazetsky) and
objective detail (from Luria) is what makes the book so enjoyable and
comprehensible.

A very good read, both informative and inspiring. I look forward to picking up
a copy of the other biography ("The Mnemonist") at some point in my travels.
