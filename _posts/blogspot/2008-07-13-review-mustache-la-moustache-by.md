Hot on the heels of "Class Trip", I just finished "The Mustache" by Emmanuel Carrère. Written some ten years earlier than "Class Trip", this is an even more astonishing book.

The main character alters his routine one morning, and instead of shaving around
his mustache of many years, decides to see how he'll look without it. From
there his world is gradually unraveled. His present and future are tinged with
uncertainty, and shockingly, so is his past. His very identity begins to slip
away.

Where Gregor Samsa's transformation was grand and undeniable, the man behind (or
lacking) the eponymous mustache suffers all the more for the complete acceptance
his wife, friends, and colleagues all have of the altered reality that unfolds
around him.

This is a grand portrayal of mental anguish and paranoia. For much of the book,
the main character alternates between believing that he is insane and believing
that the world is either mad or conspiring against him. The transitions between
these two irreconcilable extremes are sometimes gradual, and sometimes
startlingly abrupt.

In his struggle to find some stability in the shifting reality he occupies, the
main character ends up becoming a kind of parody of the world traveler, latching
onto what temporary routines and human connections he can while shifting from
one impersonal locale (hotel, ferry, airport, restaurant) to another.

A bit of warning:  the ending of this book is absolutely devastating. I was
clenching my teeth when reading the last few pages, and very nearly had to bite
my knuckle to keep from crying out.

This is an absolutely vital work, and wonderfully crafted. Highly recommended,
but only for those who delight in the uncertainty and complexity of a book like
"The Metamorphosis" and who also have a strong stomach.
