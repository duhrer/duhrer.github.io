I've been a fan of Philip K. Dick's writing for quite a while, having purchased
and hungrily read every novel on which he was the single author, most of his
short stories, and a fair bit of his nonfiction writing. If you aren't
familiar, it's very hard to pick even a small handful for the novice, but I
would recommend in particular:

* "Now Wait for Last Year" (my favorite)
* "Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said"
* "The Man in the High Tower"
* "A Scanner Darkly"

To return to the point:  as a long-time fan of PKD, it was a pleasure to
discover (while following up on a friend's recommendation of the PKD biography
"I am Alive and You Are Dead", review to come shortly) that not one, but two of
the author's mainstream novels are now being printed widely for the first time,
and over twenty years after the author's death. "Voices from the Street" is in
fact the last of his unpublished novels to go to press, adding to my excitement
in devouring the work.

Like his other mainstream novels, "Voices" is a work steeped in the culture of
1950s California. The salesman and their world, the attitudes of the characters
toward race issues, even the details regarding music sales are familiar from
PKD's mainstream works like "Mary and the Giant" and (my favorite) "In Mliton
Lumky Territory". As always in both his mainstream and Science Fiction novels,
the relationships between women and men are complex and often strained,  as in
"Mary", "Milton Lumky", and "Confessions of a Crap Artist".

"Voices" is an earlier effort along the same rough lines as his later mainstream
work, and it shows a little. I was reminded of my experience in reading Henry
Miller's "Moloch" a few years ago, which was a similar mining of an author's
early work, with similar rough edges. A friend of mine who is also reading the
book pointed out that the characters' voices are a bit too obviously mouthpieces
for the author and not characters in their own right. I would reluctantly
agree, although I tend to enjoy Dick's descriptive detail and narrative rather
and not be bothered by his characterizations.

I won't go into the details of the story much further, as I'm increasingly wary
of spoiling anything for future readers. I will say, however, that like so many
of PKD's works, whether or not the end resolution is positive depends largely on
the reader's perspective. For those of you that make it through the book, I
offer this:  the main character reminds me of Grady at the end of Michael
Chabon's excellent "Wonder Boys". For anyone who's read both, I hope the
comparison makes sense, if not, that's what the comments section of this blog is
for.

Although I am far from an unbiased consumer of PKD's work, I enjoyed "Voices"
very much, even though it was emotionally exhausting to read in comparison with
his Science Fiction novels. If you have read and enjoyed "Milton Lumky" or
other mainstream PKD novels, I highly recommend it. If you're unsure, you could
do a lot worse than picking up one of the many new editions of his work that are
now being reprinted.
