"Cold Stone Jug" by Herman Bosman was recommended to me during a trip to South
Africa earlier this year. I ended up acquiring the anniversary edition, which
finally came a few weeks ago. The book is in the same family as Dostoevsky's
"House of the Dead", which similarly fictionalizes a real-life stint behind
bars.

Like "House of the Dead", "Cold Stone Jug" describes the day-to-day prison
experience.  The people, the clothes, the environment, the routines, all are
described in intimate detail. Like "House of the Dead", the narrator moves from
a death sentence to a fixed term in prison, to release. Even the reliance on
the prison infirmary as a release from the monotony of prison life is
duplicated.

What makes both works enjoyable is the hopefulness, strained though it is at
times. We know that somehow the narrator survives the ordeal, somehow his humor
and wit survive. The anniversary edition in particular is enjoyable because it
includes prefaces, etc that firmly root the work in the biography of Bosman and
in the reality of the penal system he was incarcerated in.

Like any good book, this book left me wanting to read more from and about the
author. Further reviews of the author's work to follow...
