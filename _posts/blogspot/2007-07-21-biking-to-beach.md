Elaine and I went for a bike ride from Stornoway over toward Pointe, and stopped
at a nice beach (this beach, unlike the beach near us, has sand rather than salt
grass and rocks). [Here's the route we used](http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-kingdom/stornoway/624372861).

Photos to follow shortly.
