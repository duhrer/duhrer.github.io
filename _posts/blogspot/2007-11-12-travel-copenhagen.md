Elaine and I are finally putting up our photos from our recent trip to
Copenhagen, so I thought I'd take a minute to write a little bit about it. You
can see our [photos
from Copenhagen](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/sets/72157603117660404/) and [a
bunch of new panoramas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/sets/72157601786191078/) in [our space on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/).

We stayed in Copenhagen for about a week. Our hotel was a very modest place
called the Cab Inn Hotel, which was relatively inexpensive, but fit the bill
well enough. On [our first
day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/copenhagenday1/) (a Sunday), many of the museums were open, so we ventured out and saw
the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, which has a great collection of sculpture. After
that, we visited the ruins under Christiansborg Palace. We also visited the
Museum of Erotica, which was reasonably entertaining. We finished up the day
with a tour and a 3D IMAX movie at the Tycho Brahe Planetarium.

On [the
second day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/copenhagenday2/), we went to Den Hirschsprungske Samling, a small museum of Danish
art from the 19th century. We also did a fair amount of shopping, including a
visit to my favorite knife shop (Henkels).

On [the third
day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/copenhagenday3/), we went to the Carlsberg Brewery in the morning, and then met up with
my Aunt Evalin and cousin Lauren. We went on a canal tour together in the
afternoon, and then walked up to the Rund Tarne, where I managed to shoot a
pretty ambitious panorama.

On [the
fourth day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/copenhagenday4/), we went to the Cathedral and Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde.
While we were at the cathedral, we were delighted to witness a crew carefully
hauling a coffin out of a crypt for restoration, which was a fitting Halloween
occurrence. While we were at the Viking Ship Museum, we got to dress up as
Vikings and pose on a Viking ship, which was even better. We finished up the
night by attending a live Jazz performance.

On [the fifth
day](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/copenhagenday5/), we went to the Lousiana Art museum, the highlights of which were the
Lucian Freud exhibit and the Islamic book illustrations. We then went to
"Hamlet's Castle" in Helsingore. We finished up the day with a tour of
Helsingborg, Sweden, where we had a nice dinner (fondue, yes it's Swiss, but it
was good).

On [the
sixth](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/copenhagenday6/) and last full day, we met at Lauren's favorite bakery and sampled the
local pastries. After that, we took the bus to the [Assistens
Kirkegaard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaineandtony/tags/assistenskirkegaard/), a large cemetary in Copenhagen. We saw Niels Bohr's grave as
well as Hans Christian Andersen's grave, and took a number of photos of the
scenery and statuary there. Before and after, we did a bit of shopping here and
there, as Christmas is coming up. We had a final meal as a full group, and then
said our goodbyes to Aunt Evalin and Lauren over coffee and very nice seasonal
beer.
