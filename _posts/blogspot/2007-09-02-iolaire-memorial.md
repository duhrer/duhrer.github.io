Elaine and I took a nice bike ride out to the Iolaire Memorial, which
commemorates the sinking of the [HMS Iolaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iolaire) while carrying
soldiers returning from World War I home to the Isle of Lewis.

It was a lovely day (if a bit windy). You can see our photos (including a few
nice panoramas) here:
