"Against a Dark Background" is the first of Iain M. Banks' novels I've read that
is not set in the "Culture" universe. If nothing else, he easily demonstrates
that he doesn't need to fall back on the established conventions from those
novels to spin a good yarn. This is a book with invention and narrative detail
to burn. Ideas that would have been the central premise of a science fiction
novel written in the 1950s are tossed around like confetti.

As the title suggests, this is a darker work than "Player of Games" or "State of
the Art" (I'd say it's on par with "Use of Weapons"). Sharrow, the central
character is haunted and hunted by her past, and pursues her destiny as
everything and everyone she loves is methodically stripped from her. In this
sense, it is a punishing novel, establishing a raft of characters at length only
to make their absence that much more painful.

The culture in which she and her team travel is space-faring and has progressed
to peaks of scientific achievement and then descended into relative savagery.
The star system in which the story is set has been shaped by conflict bred of
isolation, similar to "The Mote in God's Eye". There is advanced science left
over from earlier ages, which includes the "Lazy Gun", the MacGuffin for this
particular journey. The "Lazy Gun" is a weapon that is almost cartoonish in its
effects, I'm surprised the author stopped short of having it drop anvils on its
victims. This makes a nice change from the usual doomsday device, all deus and
machina, with very little humor.

I finally found a copy of "Trillion Year Spree", the sweeping history of Science
Fiction by Brian Aldiss, and even in the first few pages, it's provided some
relevant insights regarding gothic novels as the forerunners of Science Fiction
novels:

> "Other planets make ideal settings for brooding landscapes, isolated castles,
> dismal towns, and mysterious alien figures; often, indeed, the villians may be
> monks, exploiting a local population under the guise of religion."
> <cite>"Trillion Year Spree" by Brian Aldiss (with David Wingrove)</cite>

This is indeed a gothic novel, full of moody environs, steeped in protracted
mysteries and eventual revelations. On that level, it's straightforward enough,
and in fact just a little disappointingly so. Where the novel really shines are
in the details, the set pieces established along the way. Parts of the novel,
such as the boat heist, the android city, and the train heist are compelling and
enjoyable. The overarching plot is just the excuse the author gives himself to
progress from set piece to set piece. I would urge anyone who enjoys compelling
ideas and descriptive detail to just enjoy the individual squares in the quilt,
and not to think too much about the overall design.
