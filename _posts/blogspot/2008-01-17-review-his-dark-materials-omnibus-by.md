Early in December, my wife and I went to see the movie "The Golden Compass" with
my mother-in-law in Los Angeles. My mother-in-law has been listening to the
audio version of "The Golden Compass", and a nibble through a few sections of
the omnibus edition held my attention, so I picked up the book as yet another of
many gifts to myself for Christmas. I read through the book on the way back to
Scotland, and finished it a few days ago.

Years ago, when I finally read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep". I was
disappointed that the spirit of the work had been stripped away to make "Blade
Runner", leaving behind a beautiful surface reading of the work cast as sci-fi
noir. It was a succesful and great film, but I wonder if it couldn't have still
been great and retained some of the philosophical, psychological and spiritual
aspects of the novel.

I had a similar feeling when reading "The Golden Compass". I hope that now that
the groundwork is laid out, the rest of the trilogy can come to the screen with
a little more of its spirit intact.
