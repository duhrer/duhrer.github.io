After reading the excellent "I Am Alive and You Are Dead" a while ago, I
promised myself to track down other books by Emmanuel Carrère. On a recent trip
to Paris, I did just that, picking up translations of "Class Trip" and "The
Moustache" (likely the next book I'll read).

In "Class Trip", we see inside the mind of and look out from the eyes of
Nicholas, a troubled boy, an outcast, on the cusp of adolescence, whose morbid
fantasies give him comfort even as they begin to come true. We as adults
understand many of the things that are mysteries to young Nicholas, which does
not soften our own horror at detecting some of the hard truths that seem on the
verge of being revealed to him throughout the book.

The book is simultaneously accessible and dense. The words flow by, the sense
of Nicholas' internal struggles are astonishingly well rendered.   At the same
time, there are things unsaid that challenge the reader to keep track of the
full range of possibilities, evaluating each new development in the light of
what may or may not be the truth behind Nicholas' overheard whispers and
imaginings.

I suspect that this is not only a good, but a great book, and look forward to
reading it again fresh after a few months.
