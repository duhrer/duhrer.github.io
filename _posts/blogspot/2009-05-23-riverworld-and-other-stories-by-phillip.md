In between reading "To Your Scattered Bodies Go" and "The Fabulous Riverboat" by
Philip José Farmer, I took a brief detour and read "Riverworld and Other
Stories", which contains the original novella on which the Riverworld series is
based.

I would recommend reading the Riverworld novella after "To Your Scattered Bodies
Go". As a reader, it's a lot easier to digest the background concepts if you're
reading about them as a character experiences them for the first time. In the
novella, we join the characters some years after the initial resurrection,
without a lot of clear exposition up front. Without having read them, I think
of the novella as a beta version of the fifth and six novels, which cover side
trips outside the main arc of the Riverworld storyline.

Although the Riverworld novella is the highlight of the collection, there are
other entertaining moments. I was surprised to learn that "The Henry Miller
Dawn Patrol" was first published in Playboy, and yet "J. C. on the Dude Ranch"
was not. Both are fun and raunchy stories, and wouldn't be out of place a few
pages away from a centerfold. "The Problem of the Sore Bridge" was also a fun
one for anyone who's a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle with a lot more humor and a
dash of Lovecraft thrown in for good measure.

In short, if you can find a copy of the collection, pick it up, but read the
novella at least after "To Your Scattered Bodies Go".
