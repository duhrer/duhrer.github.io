I went for my first long run of the year, you can see the route below. It was
clear and sunny and warm for this time of year. The wind was a bit strong, it
kept blowing my earphones out of my ears. I saw five ships anchored off the
coast, which was unusual and kept things interesting as I tried to figure out
what kinds of ships they were, etc. A lovely day and a good run, hopefully the
first of many for the season.
