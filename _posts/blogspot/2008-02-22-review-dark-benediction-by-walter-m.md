As you may have noticed, I tend to process books by comparing them with books
I've already read. Having just finished two collections of short stories, I
figured I would write a review of both and compare them to each other.

"Dark Benediction" is a collection of stories by Walter M. Miller, most famous
for having written "Canticle for Liebowitz". "State of the Art" is billed as
the only collection of short stories by Iain M. Banks, whose "[Player
of Games](/2008-02-07-review-player-of-games-by-iain-m-banks)" I recently finished and reviewed here.

I enjoy well written short stories quite a bit, as you may have guessed from my
earlier reviews of the [Saki](/2007-08-12-saki-complete-short-stories)
and [Charles
Herman Bosman](/2007-11-18-review-celebrating-bosman) collections. A good short story cuts away a lot of the
descriptive detail and just presents the bare ideas. Some authors (such as
Borges) excel at the short form. Others such as Philip Dick write good short
stories with the occasionally brilliant highlight. 

Of the two collections, I would say that "Dark Benediction" is the better
collection. Many of the stories are memorable, engaging, poignant, with only
the occasional misfire that seems dated or rings hollow. I highly recommend the
collection (previously published as "The Best of Walter Miller Jr").

"State of the Art" on the other hand, is somewhat uneven. A number of the
stories seem like early attempts. They don't build up much of an engaging set
of ideas, and their resolution is unsatisfying (I particularly disliked "Odd
Appendage", which just felt like a poorly crafted joke told at too great a
length rather than a decent story). The two that rise above the rest are
"Descendant" and the titular "State of the Art". "State of the Art" is a
novella set in the same universe as "Player of Games", and the longer form suits
the material and Banks' writing style. The dynamic of "State of the Art" is well
chosen, as it allows Banks to expound on the Culture as well as Earth in the
late 1970s.   I'd say it's worth picking up a copy just for "State of the Art"
and "Descendant", but I'll probably stick to his longer works from now on.
