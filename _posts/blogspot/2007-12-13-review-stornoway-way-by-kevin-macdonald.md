On the trip across the Atlantic, I picked up a copy of the "The Stornoway Way",
written by a Stornowegian author about Stornoway and Lewis. Through the
character of R. Stornoway, we are treated to a choice selection of
hard-drinking, devilish characters, all tinged with recognizable bits of the
town in which (and island on which) Elaine and I live.

Like the main character in "Filth" by Irvine Welsh, R. Stornoway is at times
hard to take, cruel to those around him, self-destructive. However, R.
Stornoway has his genuinely romantic moments, and is thus much easier to
sympathise with. The work as a whole is less an exercise in masochism for the
reader than "Filth", which is a bit of a relief.

All in all, I'd say someone with a dark enough sense of humor and sympathy for
somewhat unlikeable characters will hopefully get something out of it.
