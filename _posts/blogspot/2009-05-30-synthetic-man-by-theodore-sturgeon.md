In preparation for an upcoming move (across town), I've been working through a
pile of books so that I can sell them back to the Book Exchange and lighten the
load a bit. One of the recent quickies I whipped through is "The Synthetic Man"
by Theodore Sturgeon. I had previously read and enjoyed "[More
Than Human](/2009-05-30-synthetic-man-by-theodore-sturgeon)", which was featured in the Gollancz "Sci-fi Masterworks"
collection that revived my interest in reading the classics of the genre.

This book reminds me of "Blood Music" by Greg Bear. The protagonist of both
books has a power he is at first unaware of, but which grows as his confidence
and awareness grow. In this case, we follow "Horty", a boy who becomes an
extraordinary man. He is both more and less than human. As mentioned on the
back cover, as a boy he loses three fingers, which reminded me of "[Demon with a Glass
Hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_with_a_Glass_Hand)" just a little bit, even though the two stories are very different.

A better comparison is with Borges' "The Circular Ruins", where a man is
imagined into being by another man until the imagined man assumes a life of his
own. This book seems like a simpler treatment of the same idea. 

Still, it's entertaining enough. If you want a quick read that lies somewhere
between the heady fare of Borges and the guilty pleasure of pure space opera,
there are worse ways to spend your time.
