It's easy to think of legendary Science Fiction authors in the past tense.
If you're like me, you may have encountered classics like "Forever War" decades
after they were written. If you're a fan of used book stores and are
reading an older edition of "Forever War", the "other works by" page at
the front or back of the book might give you the idea that Haldeman hasn't done
anything in a while.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Joe Haldeman has been hard at work for
decades turning out a great body of novels and short stories, including quite a
few Nebula and Hugo award winners. Along the way, he's revisited the world of
"Forever War" a few times (in "Forever Free" and ["A Separate
War"](/2008-05-11-review-separate-war-other-stories-by)), and written two novels
(["Planet of Judgment"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_Judgment) and
["World Without
End"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Without_End_%28Haldeman_novel%29)) set
in the Star Trek universe (original series), which I can't wait to track down.
He wrote the screenplay for ["Robot
Jox"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Jox) as well (here's hoping the [film
version of "Forever
War"](http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/10/13/the-forever-war-ridley-scott-returns-to-sci-fi/)
will fare better).

"Marsbound", published last year in paperback, is a story about a girl who comes
of age just as humanity is establishing its first colony on Mars. In
Philip K. Dick's novels (such as "The Divine Invasion" or "The Three Stigmata of
Palmer Eldritch"), the lives of human colonists are both harsh and tedious, but
mostly the latter. Theirs is a life of awful isolation and drudgery from
which they try to escape, and rarely succeed.

The colony in "Marsbound" is a more hopeful affair, an energetic team of
pioneers and their children. There is hard work, and drudgery, and the
conditions are dangerous, but there is also comradery, humor and even romance.
Carmen is coming of age at the perfect time to find her place in the world, and
to witness and participate in amazing events. The main character of ["Accidental
Time Machine"](/2010-01-08-accidental-time-machine-by-joe-haldeman) finds his
way out of the doldrums of his wasted youth and eventually hits his stride (a
brisk jog settling into a comfortable walk). Carmen finds her pace (and place)
early, and sprints through the amazing times in which she lives.

This is a hopeful and human novel, and well worth reading.
