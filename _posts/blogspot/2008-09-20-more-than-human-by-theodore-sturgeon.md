I sat down to write this review after reading "More than Human" by Theodore
Sturgeon and "Cryptozoic" by Brian Aldiss within a day of each other. I had
thought at first that "Cryptozoic" was the older work, and had hoped that might
explain the somewhat dated feel of "Cryptozoic" and the apparent modernity of
"More Than Human". In fact, "More Than Human" was printed in 1953, and
"Cryptozoic" in 1967. I suppose what makes "More Than Human" the more timeless
work is in part the fact that it tends to show rather than tell. In reading
"More Than Human", we experience the evolution of a new communal being as a
series of experiences, with words that seem to come naturally from those
experiencing it. Rather than telling us about the technology involved through
one or more characters, Sturgeon shows us an extended example of evolving human
potential and the impact of that evolution on ethics (personal rules for
conduct) and morals (societal rules for conduct).

This is, in short, a classic.
