The next stop on my world tour was San Fransisco, where I spent a week with my
colleagues at Atlassian. Most of them were feverishly getting ready for our
annual Summit, but there were still plenty of opportunities to put faces to
names and get to know the extended family of Atlassians and ex-Atlassians.
There's a love, excitement, and drive common to so many Atlassians that at times
it seems less like a job than a life philosophy. It was a blast to meet so many
of them at a go, and I gather I'm in for an even bigger dose in Sydney.

In addition to meeting and talking with so many new people, I was fortunate
enough to eat some nice sushi, a sausage biscuit (bliss!), and to have three
really great burritos and a bit of Mayan food as well.

The last day of my visit, the Atlassian Support team in SF had a picnic in
Golden Gate Park. Here are a few photos:

Here's hoping the rest of the trip is as much fun.
