Having just finished "The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian" (also by
Sherman Alexie), I dove right in to "Flight" with some relish.

It was a bit uncanny, in that "Flight", like "Diary", is another coming of age
story. "Zits", the main character in flight, has fallen through the cracks, has
no family, no friends, and even before his sixteenth birthday is on a downward
spiral towards prison or the grave, to become yet another [Lee Boyd Malvo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltway_sniper_attacks),
[Seung-Hui
Cho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seung-Hui_Cho), or [William Morva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morva).

His descent is miraculously halted, and somehow he is ultimately able to reach
out and rejoin the world. The narrative device used (which I won't spoil) is a
variation on the same type of forced reflection that transforms Scrooge, George
Bailey, or Sam Beckett (the character from "Quantum Leap", not the playwright).

What I particularly like about Alexie's variation on the theme is that it allows
him to construct a range of vignettes, presenting characters of different races,
classes, ages (as in old or young) and ages (as in past or present). In each of
these vignettes, Zits learns that although he has the potential for violence, he
also still cares about the victims of violence, betrayal, abandonment.

This is a work about the power of empathy to broaden us and help us remember our
involvement with the rest of the world. We may be sad and isolated, but we are
all human. It's also a more adult work, steeped as it is in the violence of the
modern world.

I might not recommend this to younger readers who enjoyed "The Absolutely True
Diary of a Part-Time Indian", but I would recommend it to nearly everyone else.
