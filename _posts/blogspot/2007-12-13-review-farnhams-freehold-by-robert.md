I ran into a friend at a conference in California, he recommended "Farnham's
Freehold" by Robert Heinlein, but pointed out that he had repeatedly failed to
make it through the work (I now understand why, in addition to race issues,
there is a conversation between father and daughter that most would read as
"creepy").

The work deals (as much of the best Science Fiction does) with the end of the
modern world and the beginning of something new. Heinlein in particular has
used this device at least three times (in this work, in "The Doorway into
Summer", and in "For Us the Living: A Comedy of Manners"). "Farnham's Freehold"
reminded me most closely of "The Doorway into Summer". The main character in
each travels back and forth through time, allowing a dual comparison in which
the man of the present makes sense of the future and in which the man of the
present, aware of the future, returns to make sense of the past.

The future in which Farnham finds himself inverts the historical race division
of the United States such that whites are now slaves whose lives are controlled
absolutely by "The Chosen" (who are the dark-skinned ruling class primarily of
African descent). Whether you enjoy this book may boil down to the spirit in
which you believe the work was written. If (as I do), you believe the work is a
study in the tendency of power to corrupt, and the willing ignorance of the
dominant culture of the abuses their power lends itself to, then the work is
enjoyable. If instead you believe (as I have read elsewhere) that the work is
an exercise in validating negative stereotypes, then at best you probably won't
get much out of it, and at worst you may actively dislike the work and by
extension the author.

If you want to find more discussion about the book, I'd suggest starting with [the
"Farnam's Freehold" entry in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnham%27s_Freehold).
