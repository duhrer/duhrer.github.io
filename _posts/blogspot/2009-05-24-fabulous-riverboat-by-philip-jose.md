Having read and enjoyed "To Your Scattered Bodies Go" and the "Riverworld"
novella that predated it, I decided to work my way through Philip José Farmer's
"Riverworld" series on a recent trip.

The first novel in the series brings us the first seven years of life on the
Riverworld. This book resumes the story not long after from the viewpoint of
different characters. The central character of "The Fabulous Riverboat" is none
other than Mark Twain, and the eponymous riverboat is his dream made real
through sacrifice, gut-wrenching political compromise, and the introduction of
industrialized society to the pastoral Riverworld.

Not a lot is revealed of the makers of the Riverworld or their purposes in this
installment. From the previous book, we known that riverworld is peopled with
the entirety of human history, distributed in a mixture that favors a dominant
society in each area, but mixes in people, languages, and ideas from other times
and place. We have been told that the goal is to stimulate personal growth, and
to give every human the chance to reach a kind of enlightenment. In this
installment, there are no big surprises or revelations. Instead, we see how
strong characters from history soften or amplify their character over the years.

This book is a smallish stepping stone in the epic series, but it's an enjoyable
one. Stay tuned for the upcoming review of "The Dark Design", in which the
series really hits its stride.
