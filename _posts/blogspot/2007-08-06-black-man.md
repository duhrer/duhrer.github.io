Just picked up Richard Morgan's latest, ["Black
Man"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Man-Gollancz-Richard-Morgan/dp/0575075139/ref=pd_bowtega_1/203-0016042-2003962?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186352035&sr=1-1).

I've read each of his previous books, which offer a nice mix of adrenaline and
compelling hard SF concepts. I plan to start reviewing the books I read
somewhat, will let you know how the latest prize goes.
