While preparing for our current trip to Copenhagen, I realized I hadn't put up
the photos from our first trip to London, which can be found here: [

Our first trip, we mostly hit the sights and a couple of museums. Elaine and I
had wanted to visit the Tate Modern since its renovation in the 90s, it wasn't a
disappointment.

We're planning another trip to see our friends in Cambridge at Thanksiving, and
will have more photos from that trip soon.
