My journey around the world continued in Sydney, where the home office for [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/) is located. This
was my first trip to the mothership, and it was a blast. I got to meet a lot of
amazing people, put faces to names, and have a lot of face to face conversations
that would ordinarily take place over blogs and email.

Although I worked most of the time I was there, I was lucky enough to take a
little time to check out the [Sydney
Biennale](http://www.biennaleofsydney.com.au/) and a great exhibit at the [White
Rabbit Gallery](http://www.whiterabbitcollection.org/). My favorite pieces were
the video installation at the Biennale in which a couple walk naked through a
waterfall, and the installation at White Rabbit in which a van was reskinned
with a carefully painted canvas, and hooked up to a pump so that it appeared to
breathe in and out.

I also enjoyed visiting Manly Beach, where I read Walter Tevis' "Mockingbird"
from cover to cover (review coming soon). I mistakenly referred to Manly Beach
as "Manly Island" when purchasing my ferry ticket, and the ticket vendor
corrected me. After a few seconds, I thought it over and said "I guess no Manly
is an island". The ticket vendor thought it over for a second, and then made a
little eye movement as the pun sank in.

Before, during, and after work I managed to have some great meals in Sydney. The
highlights were the Vegemite and toast at the coffee shop just south of the
office, the Laksa on Hunter Street, the pies at [Central Baking
Depot](http://www.timeoutsydney.com.au/venue/restaurant/patisserie/central-baking-depot.aspx),
the pulled pork sandwich at [Four Ate Five](http://www.fouratefive.com), the Pho
at the place under Wyndham Station and the Roti Canai at
[Mamak](http://www.mamak.com.au/).

Here are a few photos from the trip:

Here's a video of the ferry trip to Manly Beach:
