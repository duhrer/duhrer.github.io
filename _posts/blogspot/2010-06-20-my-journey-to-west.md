For the month of June, I'm traveling around the world on business, hitting the
following ports of call:

- [Boulder](/2010-06-20-journey-to-west-part-1-boulder-colorado)
- [San Francisco](/2010-06-20-journey-to-west-part-2-san-francisco)
- [Sydney](/2010-07-04-journey-to-west-part-3-sydney)
- [Singapore](/2010-07-04-journey-to-west-part-4-singapore)
- [Kuala Lumpur](/2010-07-05-journey-to-west-part-5-kuala-lumpur)

I'll be posting from each of these places and writing about the absolute
flotilla of books I'm reading in transit. Stay tuned!
