The first stop in my world tour was a side trip to see my friend Antranig in his
new home in Boulder. 

The city is lovely and so warm after Amsterdam. We did a fair amount of walking
around, which is always welcome after a long flight or three. The Boulder Creek
was swollen with snow melt after a recent hot spell, it was both relaxing and
exciting to experience the rushing water among the trees. Along the way, I was
fortunate enough to stock up on books at the excellent <a
href="http://www.boulderbookstore.com/" target="_BLANK">Boulder Book Store</a>
on Pearl Street. Afterwards, we went to the <a
href="http://www.taikosummit.com/" target="_BLANK">Taiko Summit</a> and heard
some exciting drum work.

We had our last meal together at the Boulder Dushanbe Teahouse, shown here:

We talked a lot about Qin Shi Huang Di, the first emperor of China. I'd been
taught that he unified the Chinese writing system. Fans of the film "Hero" will
remember the scene in which a rival school of calligraphy is beseiged by the
emperor's army. Thanks to Antranig's Droid and data plan, we discovered that
Wikipedia does not share that view of history (although I've since figured out
that the [Qin Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Dynasty) entry includes
something about the topic). It still made for a good conversation, particularly
given the backdrop at the [Dushan Tea House](http://www.boulderteahouse.com/),
the interior of which was crafted in Tajikistan, disassembled, and shipped to
the US.

Antranig and I have both studied Mandarin, during my visit he showed me the
remarkable Chinese learning site [Skritter](http://www.skritter.com/) on his new
Lenovo tablet. It's a paid site, but you can see the amount of polish they've
put in to justify the $10 monthly fee. You write a word and pick the right
pronunciation, and you get feedback immediately. Words are repeated
periodically based on how often you remember them correctly. The stroke
recognition is amazing. The whole experience of using Skritter is almost enough
by itself to make me go out looking for a tablet PC, iPad or the Android
equivalent.

It was a great visit, and a good start to the trip.
