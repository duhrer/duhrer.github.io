"Humpty Dumpty in Oakland" is the first PKD book I've read since finishing "I am
Alive and You are Dead", the excellent biography of Philip K. Dick by Emmanuel
Carrère. Having read about Dick's feeling (or at least his second wife's
feeling) that science fiction work was somehow beneath a real writer and knowing
that he always wished for success in mainstream novels, the above passage is
striking.

The work itself is pretty typical of Dick's mainstream novels. So many of the
elements (the dynamic of salesmen and engineers in retail, health food stores,
1950s San Fransisco) are common to "Humpty Dumpty", "Voices from the Street",
"In Milton Lumky Territory" and "Mary and the Giant". The narrative itself is
fine. As with so many of Dick's novels, there are uncertainties to be resolved,
competing views of reality that accumulate evidence until one is revealed to be
if not true, then at least the view that all the characters are willing to act
on. This and the general paranoia of the main character are typical Dick, and
enjoyable enough. What distracts in the characterization.

There's a passage in "I am Alive and You are Dead" where Carrère compares Dick's
characters to termites in a fumigated colony, coming together by reflex rather
than design. Although a bit harsh, there's a kernel of truth that stayed with
me as I read "Humpty Dumpty". It's not that the characters are entirely
unsympathetic or their situations unbelievable. It's just that they are
seemingly creatures of intellect and whim with a few "tics" thrown in rather
than consistent, emotionally mature, living creations. By way of comparison, I
finally got around to reading "The Lathe of Heaven" by Ursula Leguin a while
back. The central conceits of "Lathe" (altering reality by subconscious
thought) seemed very Phildickian to me, but the characters in LeGuin's work have
a more believable emotional center.

Characterization not withstanding, "Humpty Dumpty" is not bad, but is perhaps
best left for those who enjoy Dick's mainstream writing well enough to seek it
out.
