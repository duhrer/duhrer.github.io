In transit from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur, I stopped off to see some old friends in
Singapore. It was a short trip, but great. I hadn't seen them in about four
years, and it was great to catch up. We did a bit of touring, a lot of
shopping, and had some of the best food I've ever had. Fresh Durian, Lamb
Satay, Bo bo cha cha and Ais Kacang were among the highlights.

Here are some photos from the trip:
