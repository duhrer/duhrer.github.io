Elaine found a group that holds a couple of [dances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_country_dancing) each
week in Stornoway and Barva. We went for our first time Friday night.

We need to work on our dancing fundamentals (our waltz and box step, for
example), but on the whole the group is forgiving enough to be good for
learners, and the dances were easy enough to get into.

We had a really great time, and hope to go back whenever we can.
