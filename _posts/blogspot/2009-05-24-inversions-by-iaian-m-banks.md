I'm still working my way through the last remaining Iain M. Banks novels, and
have recently finished "Inversions". 

This book alternately presents two stories of unrequited love set in a medieval
world. One story follows a court physician through the eyes of her apprentice.
The other follows the king's bodyguard and chief concubine through war,
intrigue, and treachery. Both are very well handled, and as with other
non-Culture books like "The Algebraist", Banks shows that he can do just as well
starting from scratch as he can extending and expanding his own ideas.

Like "[The
Steel Remains](/2009-03-08-review-steel-remains-by-richard-k)" by Richard Morgan, "Inversions" is a departure into a new
genre, or at least a new facet of the same genre. In fact, if it weren't for a
few key points handled in a skillfully vague way, this would be a period romance
rather than science fiction.

For readers who are familiar with Banks' Culture novels, there are often forays
by citizens of the Culture into less advanced societies. Banks does a great job
of taking two engaging and only tangentially related stories set on the same
world and making us question whether there isn't some kind of interference by a
group like the Culture at work. It would be hard to argue that there wasn't one
agent of a higher power at work in the book, and it's tantalizing to consider
who (if anyone) might also be more than they seem.

This is a lovely book that still has its share of blood, but is a whole lot
lighter  than "[Against
a Dark Background](/2008-09-20-review-against-dark-background-by-iain)", "[Use
of Weapons](/2008-05-29-review-use-of-weapons-by-iain-m-banks)", and "[Consider
Phlebas](/2008-11-19-review-consider-phlebas-by-iain-m-banks)". It's a great book, and makes me want to give some of the author's
mainstream fiction a try.
