Having thoroughly enjoyed ["The Execution
Channel"](/2007-09-20-review-execution-channel-by-ken-macleod) and most of Ken
Macleod's novels, I was excited to pick up a copy of "Night Sessions" on a
recent trip through Inverness.

"Execution Channel" is a novel of the near-future, post 9-11. Terror, torture,
surveillance, paranoia are intertwined in a near enough future that's eerily
familiar. "Night Sessions" sets its sights a little further into the future,
and yet seems no less relevant to the world around us.

The chief obsession of "Night Sessions" is religion, and Macleod tackles the
material with his usual deep sense of history and fantastic imagination. The
world has literally been to Armageddon, and still bears the scars of the "Faith
Wars". A large portion of the world has reacted by rejecting religion nearly
altogether. The Edinburgh in which "Night Sessions" is largely set has most
traces of religion scrubbed from its public life. Churches are converted to
public halls and bars. Religion still exists, but the police go out of their
way not to be aware of their activities. It's a kind of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy, which permits religion to exist in the shadows of a secular society
without attracting its wrath.

I won't go into anything further to avoid spoiling it. This is a genre-hopping
novel, a sci-fi crime thriller steeped in the history of religion, and a great
read.  Highly recommended.
