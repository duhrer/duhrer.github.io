On a recent trip, I finally finished "Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of
the Internet". Most times, I'll wade through historical nonfiction, and it
seems unfamiliar, difficult to engage with. I've abandoned even well written
books like "The Power Broker" and "Team of Rivals" because it just wasn't
enjoyable to keep on reading. I may finally have discovered what I've been
doing wrong. In short, read what you know. Although broadening your interests
is a worthy goal, you have to build on your current knowledge and understanding
and branch out from there. Case in point:  This book deals with the history of
the internet, email, telnet, FTP, chat, all topics near to my heart, and that
made this book a great departure point for me.

Most of the technologies discussed in this book are so well established that
their RFC (requests for coment) are commandments, well understood and
inviolable. In this book, these RFCs are brought to life as the product of
careful thought, ongoing and fierce debate, and even trial and error. In short,
the technology we take for granted was crafted by sharp minds and strong
personalities working through their differences and the inevitable technical
hurdles. Most of us don't get to make this big a difference (connecting
billions of people with each other), but their success should inspire us to try
anyway.

Given how much I enjoyed this, I think it may finally be time to read up on the
history of Computer Science a bit more, perhaps with a biography of Turing...
