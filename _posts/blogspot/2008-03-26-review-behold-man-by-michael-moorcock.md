Although Michael Moorcock is so prolific that I can't claim to have read even a
tenth of his work, the works I've read have been those dealing with time travel
("The Dancers at the End of Time" series) and alternate realities (The "Oswald
Bastable" series). "Behold the Man" is a time travel story, to be sure, but it
transcends that conceit to become a fractured reflection on the nature of belief
and on the history of Christianity.

Karl Glogauer is a complex and deeply troubled former psychology student with a
strong interest in both Jung and Christianity. Glogauer has been degraded by
the world and yet is still a brilliant and independent thinker. He is full of
self-loathing, so much so that his self shifts almost completely (and at times
uncontrollably) to please those around him. He is obsessed with Christianity
intellectually, emotionally, and even sexually.

At a point of crisis in his personal life, he is given the opportunity to go
back in time.  He wants  to witness the crucifixion, to see just how much of
the New Testament is history and how much is myth (in other words, how much of
the New Testament is scripture, truth that comes from God and how much is
doctrine, the imperfect interpretation imposed by man). Instead of simply
observing and having his questions answered, Glogauer finds that history is not
as recorded in the Bible. Ultimately, he decides to correct the discrepancies,
to build up the myth of Christ by taking on the role himself.

On the surface, the plot reminded me of the excellent (but very different) "Past
Watch" by Orson Scott Card, in which time travelers correct the brutality that
followed Columbus' discovery of the new world. "Past Watch" was an intellectual
work, a reimagining of society. However well rendered, the characters of
history were ultimately pawns to be repositioned to change the outcome of the
game. 

"Behold the Man" is about belief instead. Robbed of comfort of the supposed
historical truth of the Bible, Glogauer sets out to ensure that future
Christians will not have to face a similar dilemma. Far from being a selfless
martyr, he does this in part because his own obsessions require him to do so.
Sacrificing himself for the world becomes on some level a selfish act, one of
the many astonishing contradictions in his character.

This is a brilliant and outstandingly complex book, but perhaps not for
everyone. Numerous and compound blasphemies and heresies fill the work. The
last paragraphs are reminiscent of the <a
href="http://www.angelfire.com/co/JeffersonBible/" target="_BLANK">Jefferson
Bible</a> (which removed all references to Christ's miracles), and are a final
narrative rebuttal of the story of the Gospels. 

This book will probably only appeal to the type of reader who can see the
brilliance (and perhaps even humor) of a story like <a
href="http://southerncrossreview.org/49/borges-judas-eng.htm">Three Versions of Judas</a> by Jorge Luis Borges, in which a
theologian convinces himself through tortured logic that Christ was in fact
Judas. I would love to hear from anyone else who has also read the book, as
there is much to discuss.
