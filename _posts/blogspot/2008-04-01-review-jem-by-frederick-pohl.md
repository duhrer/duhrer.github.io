I just finished another in the excellent SF Masterworks series, "Jem" by
Frederick Pohl. I had previously read all four books (are there more now?) in
Pohl's Heechee saga (although I enjoyed the later ones in the kind of way you
enjoy the fifth series of a television show, more because you enjoy the
characters and less because of the novelty or originality).

Anyway, back to "Jem". "Jem" is a well-crafted story of space colonization from
the ground floor up. The three main political blocs on Earth (countries which
export fuel, countries which export food, and countries which export labor) each
hope to exploit a newly discovered world to give them an advantage over their
rivals. They each ally themselves with one of the three sentient races on the
new world, and very nearly complete the cycle of arms race and then mutually
assured destruction on two worlds.

A good book, a quick read, with some nice characters and excellent descriptions
of the culture of the alien races. Highly recommended.
