The weather really turned around for the weekend, clearer, warmer, but with
enough of a breeze to keep the midgies away yet again.

Went for a much longer run than intended, ended up finally finding the trail to
the Arnish lighthouse. You can see the run here:

I hope to go back with Elaine on our bikes soon and take some pictures, the
views along the way and from the lighthouse are really outstanding.
