"Star Maker" is a different kind of novel, that presents a central philosophy, a
central question, and strives to answer it. The question could be phrased
as "What motivates God?" or "What is the nature of the universe that we
experience and the creative force that caused it to come into being?".

In many Science Fiction novels, there is a central conceit, a fantastic and key
difference, an idea that shapes the world we explore through the printed
page. Works like <a href="http://www.richardkmorgan.com/biog.htm">Richard
K. Morgan</a>'s "Market Forces" and his Takeshi Kovacs Trilogy explore the
passions of our present amplified through technology. These are enjoyable
works, engaging works, but are the red meat of Science Fiction in all its lusty,
escapist glory.


In "Star Maker", there are no ships, no obelisks, no buried artifacts, no
portals to other worlds. It is only awareness that makes the journey
possible. The story begins with a man who is deep in thought outside his
home on a starry evening. Like a dreamer becoming lucid, he slips in an
instant beyond ordinary reality and travels to distant worlds by means he
doesn't understand and can't fully control. Over time, we learn that he
has become caught up in the search for the Star Maker. He and his eventual
companions explore and increase their awareness, which makes it possible for
them to perceive more, explore more, until they eventually are capable of
perceiving the whole of the universe and beyond.

Stapledon's wrote "Star Maker" in the period between the two world wars, and
World War I is a central player in the introduction to his "Modern Theory of
Ethics" (<a

text online</a>). Among many things, he believed that each of us has an
underlying "<a
href="http://olafstapledonarchive.webs.com/moderntheoryethics_index.html">real
will</a>" that takes into account the goals of consciousness itself.
"Star Maker" is a broad stage on which this idea is played out.

This is an exhilliarating and at times exhausting book, but is truly great and
worth reading. Now on to a bit of red meat.
