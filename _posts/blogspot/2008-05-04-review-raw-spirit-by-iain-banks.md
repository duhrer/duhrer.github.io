I don't usually read non-fiction for pleasure, but "Raw Spirit" is not only one
of my favorite non-fiction books, but one of the best books I've read in a long
time, period.

The book is as much an autobiography as anything else, as in the process of
exploring all things whiskey, Banks shares little gems about so many other
topics. The book is littered with observations about Scotland, driving, Science
Fiction, and the start of the war we still find ourselves dealing with over five
years later. Think of it as a whiskey-themed stream of consciousness with notes
of politics and storytelling. Scotland itself is the most important component,
just as the water that feeds a distillery determines the character of the
whiskey produced.

I look forward to reading more from Banks very soon. I borrowed "Raw Spirit"
from the Stornoway library, so I also look forward to picking up my own copy of
this book, as I expect it will be a well-thumbed reference as we explore
Scotland in the next few years.
