Now that I have a steady source for paperback editions of classic science
fiction in town (the Book Exchange here in Amsterdam), I have been picking up a
sampling of books from authors I've enjoyed previously. In the latest batch, I
picked up "The Dark Side of the Earth" by Alfred Bester, whose "[The
Stars My Destination](/2007-08-26-review-stars-my-destination)" is one of the all-time classics, and whose other great
work "[The
Demolished Man](/2007-08-23-review-demolished-man)" isn't far behind.

"The Dark Side of the Earth" is a collection of short stories. As with many
collections of this type, there are a few gems and a few misfires. The
highlights of this collection are "Time is the Traitor" and "They Don't Make
Life Like They Used to". "Time is the Traitor" is a meditation on memory and
loss, and succeeds fairly well.

"They Don't Make Life Like They Used to" is a post-apocalyptic story in the same
vein as "[Night of
the Comet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087799/)" or "[The Quiet Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089869/)". In both those
films, a handful of survivors attempt to live out their lonely lives in the
ruins of our society, and have what fun they can doing it. The story is mostly
about the characters, we never really even know how the world ended. It's
speculative fiction more than science fiction, characters driven by fantastic
circumstances, but still recognizably and endearingly human.

A few of the other stories just seem a bit dated, or maybe they just didn't suit
my mood at the time I read them. Regardless, there are enough gems to make this
worth picking up.
