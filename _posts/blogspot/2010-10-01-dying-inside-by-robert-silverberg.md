Yet again I'm surprised and pleased by the [SF
Masterworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SF_Masterworks) series, most recently
for introducing me to Robert Silverberg's "Dying Inside".

"Dying Inside" sits somewhere between Kafka's "Metamorphosis" (in which a man
awakes to find himself transformed into a bug) and"The Fermata" by
Nicholson Baker (in which a man has the ability to stop time at will).
David Selig, the main character of "Dying Inside" is a mind-reader.
 Unlike the main character of "The Fermata", he cannot bring himself to
take advantage of his gift to gain an advantage (by reading stock tips, for
example). Instead, in spite of his gift, David Selig struggles through
life, vainly searching for some real connection and identification with the rest
of humanity. 

We meet him as his powers are waning, as the ability that defines him slips away
and leaves him floundering. Even at the height of his power he has not
found a connection to the people whose minds he can read, or to another telepath
he encounters, or to the rare girl he finds whose mind he cannot read. As
his powers fade, he becomes more hopeless until at last something has to give.

There's something to the phrase "mind reading". The beauty of this book is
that as reader's to David Selig's narrator, we are privileged to explore his
mind, to have his secrets opened to us and try to understand him. The
novel makes us perfect receivers, just as Selig is, but we are powerless to
transmit back, just as he is. Without his power, he struggles just as we
all must to make a connection with others, and his drama is our drama. 
This is a great book, and highly recommended.

Silverberg's "Downward to the Earth" and "Book of Skulls" are also on the SF
Masterworks list, I look forward to reading those very soon.
