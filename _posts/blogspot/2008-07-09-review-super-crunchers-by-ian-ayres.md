I read the bulk of the now-infamous "Freakonomics" while waiting for a friend to
join me for dinner. It was a very quick read, and good food for conversation.

"Super Crunchers" comes from another mind that runs in the same circles,
breaking down real-life problems into equations, struggling to explain phenomena
we see in life in terms of either random chance or human action.

Where "Freakonomics" was a bit of a ramble through a few applications of
regression, "Super Crunchers" clearly brings regression analysis to center
stage. Like the wheel, the screw, the lever, regression analysis and other
experimental methodologies are simply tools. Each of these tools was initially
expensive and required specialized knowledge, but over time became ubiquitous
and universally understood. "Super Crunchers" chronicles the emerging ubiquity
of making decisions based on statistical analysis. It also provides hints as to
the changing role of thinking individuals in a statistics based world.

A quick read, and good food for thought. Buy it for (or loan it to) someone you
plan to have dinner with and have at it.
