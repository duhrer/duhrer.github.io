"Tool of the Trade" belongs to a sub-genre of SF that could be called "Simon
Says". 

What if someone had the power to make other people do what they wanted, if free
will came with an asterisk?

This is entertaining source material that's mined over and over again in comic
books (here are two examples: <a

For the story to work, there have to be limitations on the power, a class of
people who are immune, or some other reason why life isn't infinitely easy for
someone who can just order people to do what they want. This story is no
different. It plays with the material, but only goes so far in exploring the
limits.

Haldeman's take on this sub-genre interesting is notable for its Cold War
setting, its spy-novel flair, and its ending (which I won't spoil). It's also
yet another example of Haldeman's enduring skill as a writer, which lies in
taking a slice or two of SF and applying it on a human scale, with both drama
and humor mixed in. Even when his subject is the nature of the universe itself
(as in "Forever Free"), he still fills his characters with desires, with
intelligence, with a sense of humor.
