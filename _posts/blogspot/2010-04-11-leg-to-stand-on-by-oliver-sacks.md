I finally read "A Leg to Stand On" the other day, and have been thinking about
it off and on. I enjoy Dr. Sacks' writing, from short case studies like ["An
Anthropologist on Mars"](/2008-11-23-review-anthropologist-on-mars-by-oliver)
and "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat", to autobiography like "Uncle
Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Childhood". He has an easy, engaging mix of
science and storytelling that just works, and he has a zeal for his topics
that's infectious.

"A Leg to Stand On" is a case study and autobiography in one. It describes
Sacks' experience recovering from a serious injury to his leg. In the
1970s (when his injury occurred), it was more common for patients to experience
protracted convalescences, and to have their injured limbs completely
immobilized in heavy casts. For many patients, this resulted in an
alienation for the casted body part, and it's this sense of alienation from a
part of oneself that's the focus here. This sense of alienation was not
well understood at the time, and generations of patients were unable to convey
their experience in a way that brought understanding to their doctors,
caregivers, friends and family. Patients were physically injured, their
injuries were addressed surgically, and over time they were physically better.
The physical wellness was the desired outcome. That they were
baffled and terrified during their convalescence was beside the point.

Sacks is an articulate man who is blessed with an eye for detail and a good
memory. He emerged from his convalescence with the desire to document it
for the outside world (doctors and laymen alike), and his years of experience
documenting similar experiences with his patients put him in a unique position
to tell the story and explain the science behind it. As with all of his
case studies, it's the human experiences that shine through amidst the notes on
neuroscience (and its history).

An engaging, insightful, and very human story that's well worth reading.
