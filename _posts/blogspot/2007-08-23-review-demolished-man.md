Today I started (and finished) "[The
Demolished Man](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Demolished-Man-Millennium-SF-Masterworks/dp/1857988221/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/203-3519527-0292718?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187901806&sr=8-1)" by Alfred Bester, who also wrote "[The
Stars My Destination](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stars-My-Destination-S-F-Masterworks-S/dp/1857988140/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/203-3519527-0292718?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187902104&sr=8-1)".

The opening passages of the book didn't initial strike much of a chord with me,
but as I worked my way into the narrative, I found it quite enjoyable, and can
see why it comes so highly recommended.

Like "Black Man", "Demolished Man" deals with a change in human society
resulting from the emergence of a new form of human. In "Demolished Man", the
new model of humans are "peepers", psychic individuals. Unlike the variant
thirteen genetic soldiers in "Black Man", the psychics in "Demolished Man" are a
natural stage in evolution, and are slowly becoming the dominant form of human
rather than an isolated minority.

Like "[Minority
Report](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Minority-Report-Gollancz-Philip-Dick/dp/1857987381/ref=pd_bowtega_1/203-3519527-0292718?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187942257&sr=1-1)" by Philip K. Dick, the main narrative in "Demolished Man" revolves
around someone driven to commit murder in a world in which the act of murder is
almost by definition impossible. There the similarities end. "Minority Report"
was a meditation on the imprecision of clairvoyance and the effect knowing your
fate has on your decision to act out your part of that fate. "Demolished Man"
is instead a cat and mouse game where reading someone's mind gives you access to
a truth that is more or less absolute, but which is not admissible in court, and
which must be supplemented with objective evidence.

"Demolished Man" also offers some wonderful interplay between its psychic
characters, and addresses well what relationships between psychic men and women
would be like. Unlike many lesser and cliched treatments of the subject, the
interplay of any two of the adult psychics in "Demolished Man" can be playful,
calculated, intimate, nuanced. Lesser works use ESP as a cliched device to
advance the plot and telepathy as a hands-free phone. Bester on the other hand
does a good job of demonstrating that like sign language, a new form of
communication would have its own character rather than simply being a direct
translation of written and spoken language.

"Demolished Man" is also interesting as a narrative, in that the narration
follows one character almost exclusively for the first half of the book, and
follows their nemesis almost exclusively for the last half.

I'll have to reread "The Stars My Destination" and work through the rest of the
author's work at some point (preferably this year, as the movie version of "The
Stars My Destination" may come out in 2008).
