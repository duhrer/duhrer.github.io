When I started grazing through the Sci-Fi Masterworks series a few years ago, I
had never heard of Kate Wilhelm. Her "[Where
Late the Sweet Birds Sang](/2008-03-08-review-where-late-sweet-birds-sang-by)" was a wonderful discovery, a meditation on the
changes cloning might have on the nature of individuality. Wilhelm's "[Let
the Fire Fall](/2008-09-20-let-fire-fall-by-kate-wilhelm)" reminded me of Robert Heinlein's "Stranger in a Strange
Land", with its mix of superhuman potential, power politics, and religion, and
recently I happened to read two books on similar topics by Wilhelm and Heinlein
within a few weeks of one another. I had planned to compare their takes on
immortality, but while mulling things over I read Justin Cronin's "The Passage"
(one of this summer's hot reads), and it just made sense to write about them all
in one sitting. 

Justin Cronin's "The Passage" follows the outbreak of a virus which both
prolongs human life and turns humans into unthinking monsters. These "virals"
are destroyers of life, and despised and feared by the few remaining humans, who
struggle to enjoy what little time they have on Earth amidst the horror of their
world. We follow one of the last colonies as attrition slowly grinds it away,
and a handful of adventurers who look for a last bit of hope in a long trip
across the shattered remains of America. Their story provides the same mix of
ordinary people and extraordinary times, natural and supernatural that made
Stephen King's "The Stand" such a great book to read many years ago.

In [an interview with
Trisha Page over at BookPing](http://www.bookpage.com/books-10013261-The-Passage), Cronin likens immortality to "steal[ing] the
future from our children", and this philosophy is borne out by the book. He
finds the desire for immortality misguided, the costs too high, and thus his
take on immortality is bleak, a nightmare world.

"Welcome, Chaos" tracks the accidental development of an indefinite
life-prolonging treatment during the Second World War, and its threatened
exposure to the public in the midst of the cold war. The immortals Wilhelm
depicts are also resistant to disease and radiation, and so become a kind of
nuclear deterrent that could prompt each side to start a war before the other
can protect their people. 

In addition to the struggles of world powers to control and use longevity as a
political tool and a weapon, Wilhelm focuses on the effects of longevity on
personal identity. Wilhelm's immortals are full of life and energy, but are
also less hurried, more willing to simply enjoy each day and work towards even
the most important goals on a longer scale.  They have the time to get to know
and love each other along the way. Wilhelm's take on immortality is cautious,
but hopeful. Immortality has the potential to destroy humanity, but also the
potential to free humanity from death and old age, to let people enjoy life for
as long as they care to.

"Time Enough for Love" takes this second idea to its extreme. It's a lusty tale
that follows Lazarus Long, who, through a combination of breeding for longevity
and artificial rejuvenation techniques, becomes the longest lived human.
Immortality is the secret province of a select few families, who live the
equivalent of dozens or even hundreds of normal human lifespans. These
immortals are living during a pioneer period, in which humanity is peopling the
stars.

Heinlein's is the most positive take on immortality by far. Human society is
expanding to other worlds, so even if everyone were immortal, there would be no
overcrowding, no lack of resources, no exploitation of the younger generations.
No matter how long Heinlein's immortals live or how far they go, time is longer
and space farther still. The immortals are still constrained, just on a much
larger scale. Heinlein's immortals keep going as long as they can still live in
the moment, as long as they can find ideas, challenges, friends and family to
keep them engaged and, almost literally, alive.

All three are great books for different reasons and highly recommended.
