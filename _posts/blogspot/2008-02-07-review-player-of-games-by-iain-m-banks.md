In "The Player of Games", Iain Banks presents a society centered around a game
called "Azad", which is so nuanced that life itself is a reflection of the game
and vice versa. The standing of players varies according to their performance
in the tournaments held every few years, and the winner of the tournament
assumes the role of emperor. 

Into this society is thrust a human expert in Game Theory, a man who is a
generalist, an expert in almost all games, a man perfectly suited to make sense
of "Azad" and the society that shares that name.

This book reminded me in some ways of "The Game Players of Titan" by Philip K.
Dick. In "Titan", a group of aliens from Titan imposes on human society a
simplified version of the game that is the basis of Titan's society. "Bluff" as
portrayed in "The Game Players of Titan" is a simple game by comparison with
"Azad", more about luck and psychology than complex strategy. Although "Azad"
is described in terms that leave much to the imagination, it is portrayed as a
means by which an individual's intelligence, wisdom, and even morality are
intimately tested against that of their opponents.

Banks' skills are used to good effect as he depicts the difference between the
societies, the central clash between human society ("Culture") and "Azad" is
well crafted, and his depiction of gender dynamics reminds me of some of my
favorite short stories by Ursula LeGuin.

Anyway, suffice to say I plan to read more of his novels when I get the chance.
