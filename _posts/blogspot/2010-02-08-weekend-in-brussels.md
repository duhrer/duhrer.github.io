It was Elaine's birthday on Friday, so we went to Brussels for the
weekend. We've been to Belgium before, but never as far south.
Almost immediately, I was struck by the shift to French as compared to the
Vlaamse-heavy north. It was a perfect chance for Elaine to work on her
French and for me to learn to embarass myself less in French, but we could still
take advantage of our Dutch as well.

We stayed at the [Welcome Hotel](http://www.brusselshotel.travel/), which had a nice atmosphere, a good location,
and set the right mood. We stayed in the Silk Road suite (it was her
birthday after all), and the jacuzzi was a nice way to relax after walking the
soles off our shoes per the usual.


We ate a few notable meals, including frites and mossels (of course). Our
favorite meal of the trip had to be at [Comocomo](http://comocomo.be/main.html), a Tapas restaurant where the dishes come out on a
conveyor belt as soon as they're made. It reminded me of <a
href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/frying-fish-restaurant-los-angeles">Frying Fish</a> in L.A., good variety, good quality, and
reasonable prices. They have about 45 dishes on the menu, and we tried 15,
I guess we'll have to try again at their Antwerp location.

We spent most of our time at three museums. First, we spent an afternoon
at the Koninklijke Musea, wandering through their ancient and modern art
collections. My favorites there had to be the statue of <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davesandford/4150190475/in/pool-kmskb-mrbab">Father Damian</a> (it hasn't been retitled since his
canonization), Matthieu Kessels sculpture "<a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brettdunnam/3305267088/in/pool-531121@N21">The Deluge</a>", and Paul Delvaux's "<a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/polisea/610303925/">Crucifixion</a>". If you'd like to see more items from the
collection, there's a large group of them <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/kmskb-mrbab/" target="_BLANK">on
Flickr</a>. We also visited the <a
href="http://www.trabel.com/brussel/brussels-museums-comicstrip.htm">comic strip museum</a>, in a lovely Art Nouveau building, and
caught a small but wildly popular <a
href="http://www.bozar.be/activity.php?id=9429" target="_BLANK">Frida Kahlo
exhibition</a> at the Musee de Beaux Arts ("Bozart").
