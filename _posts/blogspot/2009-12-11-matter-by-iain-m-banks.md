"Matter" is another epic space opera in the "Culture" series. I've enjoyed (and
reviewed) ["Consider
Phlebas"](/2008-11-19-review-consider-phlebas-by-iain-m-banks), ["Look to
Windward"](/2008-11-22-review-look-to-windward-by-iain-m-banks), ["Use of
Weapons"](/2008-05-29-review-use-of-weapons-by-iain-m-banks), ["Player of
Games"](/2008-02-07-review-player-of-games-by-iain-m-banks), ["Against a Dark
Background"](/2008-09-20-review-against-dark-background-by-iain),
["Inversions"](/2009-05-24-inversions-by-iaian-m-banks) and
["Excession"](/2008-10-02-review-excession-by-iain-m-banks), and "Matter" is a
fine way to end the run.

Banks is a master of bringing a fresh perspective to what could easily be
repetitive and derivative material. Often he uses contrasts to keep the
perspective fresh. In "Inversions" and "Consider Phlebas", we see The Culture
contrasted with its enemies. In most Culture novels, we see The Culture
contrasted with the more primitive societies it tries to nudge towards its
higher ideals. In "Excession", we see The Culture contrasted with both an
artifact from advanced society and its enemies.

In "Matter", we get the best of these contrasts and new perspectives to boot.
We follow one of The Culture's newest recruits as she returns to her homeworld
during a time of crisis. We also follow her brother as he works to escape the
political turmoil of his homeworld and encounters his "Cultured" sister. As if
that weren't enough, we also see how citizens (human and machine) of The Culture
deal with technologies beyond their own when cut off from the full resources of
their own society.

Banks continues to amaze with the imagination he brings to each book. The
Culture series is astonishing in its scope, and in between all the fantastic
ideas and characters are enough amusing and well-crafted phrases to make it
nearly exhausting. I'll have to get plenty of rest before the [new Culture
novel](http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Culture-Novel-Iain-Banks/dp/1841498947/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1259724973&amp;sr=8-12-spell)
is released next year. If you haven't already done so, take advantage of the
deals and reprints leading up to the new release and enjoy the whole series.
