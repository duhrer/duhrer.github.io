Just finished <a
href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Adult/dp/0747591067/ref=sr_1_2/203-0016042-2003962?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186354740&sr=1-2">"Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows"</a>. The prose was not all that challenging or
finely crafted, but the weaving of plot threads from the previous books into a
coherent whole and a consistent and satisfying ending was worth the wait. I'll
hold off on saying anything further for the benefit of anyone (like my wife) who
hasn't finished the book yet.
