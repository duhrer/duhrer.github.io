I read a lot when I travel, so there will be a quick flurry of mini-reviews of
recent conquests...

I just finished the next novel in the Aubrey/Maturin series. Satisfyingly, each
novel manages to build on the last without taking much for granted. "Mauritius
Campaign" is no exception. In it we find Jack Aubrey moving out of his
long-awaited domestic "bliss" and into the rank of Commodore. Maturin also
plies his skills on a somewhat larger stage, and it is interesting to finally
see him interact with a skilled (if flawed) peer whose medical expertise is more
in the field of psychology.

Suffice to say, an enjoyable read, I plan to continue with the series after
taking a wide detour through a bunch of Science Fiction.
