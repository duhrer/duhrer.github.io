I had never read any Science Fiction coming out of the former Soviet Union until
I finally sat down and read "Roadside Picnic", one of the few remaining books in
the Sci-Fi Masterworks series. 

The Strugatsky brothers describe a world scarred by alien visitation. The
central metaphor is of a roadside picnic viewed by the ants, for whom each piece
of trash left behind is an artifact of a god-like intelligence. The unseen
aliens are the picnickers, and we are the ants.  The picnickers left behind
scarred, altered places, littered with strange artifacts and dangers. The
artifacts bring new discoveries, new technologies, new money to those daring
enough to find, study and exploit them. Enter the "stalkers", fortune hunters
who brave strange death to retrieve alien artifacts and sell them to those who
would study them.

What makes this book great is that the dynamic it describes is only marginally
related to alien technology or even science. "Roadside Picnic" is really a
study of how money is exchanged for life. Some sell their lives as a hopeful
gesture, thinking that their sacrifice will mean greater things for themselves
and their family. Some sell their lives for drink, and smoke, and women, and
then risk it all for another day of the same. All are making the same choices
that people have made for millenia, and are recognizably human and full of life,
love, and fear. Put another way, it's a study of the potential of capitalism,
and the terrible costs. 

As with many translated works, the language, expressions, and meter are a bit
strained at times, but it rarely detracts from the book. It's a great book, a
quick read, and well worth the time.
