The last stop in my world tour was Kuala Lumpur, where I spent a week with my
colleagues at <a
href="http://www.customware.net/repository/display/CustomWare/Home">Customware</a>. They work European working hours, so it was a
college student's dream job: roll into work at 3, leave at midnight. The
team is a diverse bunch of smart, enthusiastic, and energetic people, and they
went out of their way to be great hosts as well. We usually ate dinner
together, and we managed a few lunches and (after midnight) suppers as well.
It's hard to cover how amazing the food is in Malaysia, but among other things,
while I was there I enjoyed:


- [Nasi
  Lemak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasi_Lemak), the national dish of Malaysia.
- [Roti
  Canai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti_canai), a local interpretation of Indian flat bread
- [Otak
  Otak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otak-otak), a seasoned fish mousse steamed in banana leaves
- [Rojak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojak), a
  sweet salad of fruit and vegetables in a thick brown sauce
- [Assam and Curry
  Laksa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laksa), two noodle soups that are justly famous around the world.
- fresh[Popia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popia),
  tasty uncooked spring rolls filled with vegetables, a light brown sauce, and
  crunchy treats like peanuts.
- fresh [Guava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guava)
  with a little bit of sweet and sour seasoning

The KL team are really active on Facebook, here's a good starting point to see what we were up to during my trip:

It was a great visit, long enough to get to know everyone a little, but short enough to make me want to come back and visit again.
