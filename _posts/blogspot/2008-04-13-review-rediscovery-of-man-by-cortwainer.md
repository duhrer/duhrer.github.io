"The Rediscovery of Man" is a collection of short stories (all set in the same
universe at different time periods) by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordwainer_Smith" target="_BLANK">Cortwainer
Smith</a>. This universe is largely ordered by the Instrumentality, a governing
body spanning centuries and controlling in fine detail the lives of almost every
living human.

Like Huxley before him, Smith imagines a world in which genetics and behavioral
conditioning sanitize life to the point where individual achievement is nearly
meaningless. Smith's Instrumentality extends the control of science over nature
somewhat further than Huxley, to the point where everyone is allocated 400 years
of life (instead of the roughly 80 years of youth the denizens of Huxley's
"Brave New World" lived). They live without fear of disease, weather, aging,
hunger or the lack of material goods. Access to history is tightly controlled,
and all divisions of language and culture have been more or less erased. At the
height of the Instrumentality, the only human individuals not perfectly adjusted
to the needs of their society and their own ability to fulfill those needs are
extreme aberrations (and extremely rare).

The title "The Rediscovery of Man" refers to the reemergence of chance and
diversity as means of allowing the human race continued growth. This relaxation
of some of the controls on their society arises in no small part from the study
of undermen, animals modified to resemble, interact with, and serve humans.
Early in the timeline of the Instrumentality, undermen are slaves, less than
human, destroyed when they fail or become inconvenient. They are utterly
disposable labor, and only those who are strong, witty, and lucky survive. Thus
it is that the various species of underpeople grow while the human race in its
perfect control over heredity and environment stagnates.

The reemergence of human progress and the rise of the underpeople are two of the
major themes. Minor themes include telepathy, the mob mentality and the
progress of societies and technologies over millenia. Like Tolkien's Middle
Earth, you get the sense that Smith had a full vision of this universe
stretching over millenia, and that each story was just a window into a
fully-realized world.

This is a great collection of stories, well worth reading and rereading. I look
forward to reading the small collection of additional fiction works by the
author.
