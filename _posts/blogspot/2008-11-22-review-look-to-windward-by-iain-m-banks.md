"Look to Windward" opens with the same T. S. Elliot quote as "Consider Phlebas",
the first of Iain Banks' Culture novels, and the books are in a sense are
companion pieces. Where "Consider Phlebas" deals with the Idiran war, "Look to
Windward" deals with the aftermath of both the Idiran war and the interference
of the Culture in a civil war among the Chelgrians.

Like his other Culture novels, "Look to Windward" has quite a few digressions,
but in this case all of the subplots are more less recognizably in the service
of the larger plot. As with his previous novels, there are rich descriptions of
the natural and constructed environments, which as always are engrossing.

What is singular and enjoyable about this novel, however, are the two central
characters, one a Chelgrian, one a "Mind", an artificial intelligence centuries
old. As in "Consider Phlebas", the Chelgrian character in part acts as a foil to
help us understand the nuances of the Culture by comparison.

I particularly liked the insight into the "Mind", whose perception of time and
scope of focus are so far outside human experience that it can live a lifetime
of our experiences in an instant and coordinate billions of decisions where we
would be hard pressed to handle a handful.

Banks is as always incredibly inventive. Each twist in the plot is an "a-ha
moment", an expansion of our own imagination rather than the kind of contrivance
that drives your average mystery (or CSI episode, for that matter).

An entertaining read, particularly the last few chapters, in which all the loose
ends are tied up. Although for the most part the right are redeemed and the
wrong horribly punished, it never seems arbitrary, it always just <span

A good book, and highly recommended, particularly for anyone who has enjoyed
other Culture novels.
