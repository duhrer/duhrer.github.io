I'm continuing to work my way through the Gollancz SF Masterworks series, which
is just chock full of great stuff. I found <a
href="http://www.teknohippy.net/mw/" target="_BLANK">a reasonably complete list
of the scheduled and published works</a>, it looks like I've read almost exactly
half of the works on the list thus far. Many of the books on the list have been
favorites for years, some I'm finding through this series. The latest that I've
finished is "Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang" by Kate Wilhelm. 

The novel is about cloning, but more importantly, it's a well-crafted
exploration of the tensions between the individual and society, and what it
means to be an individual at all. 

The story begins in a community made up of close-knit but extended family living
in rural Virginia. Even the closest knit family would and does seem chaotic
when compared to the clone society that arises through the course of the story,
in which a clone is born part of a community and never quite comes to realize
their own individuality or even see themselves as anything other than a part of
a seamless whole. The clones exist only in relation to the rest of their pack.
Rarely, individual personalities do arise, and it is by comparison with these
individuals that the ultimate flaws in a perfectly communal society are
highlighted. There is no value in being different, and so there is no
innovation, no improvisation, no creativity.

The territory has been explored somewhat with the two clone species in "Forever
War" and "Forever Free", the clones in "Appleseed", and many other works, but
never in quite so loving a way. It's a great book with the same type of
crossover appeal that "Gattaca" had when dealing with similar themes a few years
ago, and is strongly recommended.
