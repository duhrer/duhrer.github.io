Hot on the heels of "Babycakes" and just finishing up the outgoing part of our
trip to Copenhagen, I finished "Significant Others" last night. It had a nice
structure, two groups of supposedly like-minded people getting together in their
private enclaves and a third group outside both camps. There are excursions
between the groups that highlight their differences and similarities. Along the
way, there are many playful and serious observations about class, politics,
gender, sexuality, romance, friendship. Pleasingly enough, there are a handful
of new peripheral characters that are satisfying in their own right, and
highlight new aspects of the core characters.

Anyway, I plan to read the rest of the series soon enough. For now, on to
explore Copenhagen and perhaps break into my other two books for the trip:
"Mauritius Command" (the next in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian)
and a centenary collection of the short stories of Charles Herman Bosman.
