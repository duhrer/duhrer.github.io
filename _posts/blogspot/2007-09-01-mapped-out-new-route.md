I combined parts of previous runs into a new loop that was just short of 6
miles:

It stopped short of raining outright, mostly it was spitting the whole way and
incredibly windy. I know that in a rough loop I should get an equal balance of
head and tail winds, I'm sure it only seemed like there was a lot more head than
tail.

Anyhow, I could probably add enough to top 6 miles just by turning right along
the trails at the entrance to Lews Castle, will have to give that a try on a
nicer day.
