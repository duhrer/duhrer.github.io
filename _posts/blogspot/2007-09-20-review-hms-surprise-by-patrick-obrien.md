<span style="font-style:italic;">I actually read this months ago, but had apparently left the draft lying around unpublished...</span>

My friend Sean Boles and another online friend with whom I play chess got me
interested in Patrick O'Brien's series of novels involving the characters Jack
Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. Although I have to admit that I don't consume the
Aubrey-Maturin novels as regularly or with the same gusto as other books and
authors I follow, I enjoyed "Surprise" quite a bit, just as I enjoyed the
previous two in the series ("Master and Command", and "Post-Captain").

I will again avoid spoiling the work for anyone who hasn't read it by describing
particular details. The serial nature of the work makes it especially important
to encounter the events in sequence. Instead, I will focus on the qualities of
the writing that I find particularly appealing.

I won't presume to be able to do better justice to the period authenticity or
O'Brien's ability to portray the seagoing life, many other reviewers have
commented on this, including the afterward in the particular edition of
"Surprise" I picked up, which was written by Charlton Heston. (As an aside, I
wonder about his other reading tastes, in particular whether he read "I am
Legend" before being presented with the script of and agreeing to portray the
lead role in "Omega Man").

What I admire so much about the series is O'Brien's ability to start with truly
excellent characters and to continually give us a more intimate understanding of
their lives, their growth, their interactions with each other. He also has a
fine sense of detail, narrative, pacing, and is on the whole a great writer in
every sense.

Reading this work, I can't help but think of "Moby Dick", "Middle Passage", and
any number of sea-going works (sadly few of which I've read). The
Aubrey-Maturin series is written for a relatively modern ear, making it easier
to parse than Melville.  However, far from diluting the spirit of the age he
describes, O'Brien's writing is believably rooted in the time and culture he
describes, and does not engage in obvious revisionism by inserting overly modern
characters and situations.

I look forward to continuing to read the series, and would love to hear from
others who enjoy the series.
