I recently finished "The Star Fraction" by Ken Macleod, whose work I have
enjoyed frequently since moving to his place of birth in Stornoway. I had
previously read the portions of Ken Macleod's "Fall Revolution" series that are
available at the Stornoway public library (the second and fourth books in the
series). Thankfully, each book is a standalone work with a few recurring themes
and characters, and lends itself to this treatment.

Macleod's novels commonly develop two or more narratives in parallel, such that
there's a small bit of adjustment (like a mild form of culture shock) when
moving from chapter to chapter. The reader has to hold a number of isolated
threads in memory (I know, i sound like a computer geek) until the threads start
to combine, then split apart, then recombine. His works are, in short, <span
style="font-style:italic;">satisfyingly complex</span>.

Anyway, I've now read three of the series. Of the three, I would have to say
that I enjoyed "The Stone Canal" and "The Sky Road" a bit more, but "The Star
Fraction" is still a good read and well recommended.
