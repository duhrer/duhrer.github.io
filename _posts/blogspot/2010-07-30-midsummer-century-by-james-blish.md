"Midsummer Century" is the last of the small treasure trove of James Blish
novels found in several used book stores in San Francisco during my recent
["journey to the west"](/2010-06-20-my-journey-to-west).

When I first started reading Blish (with ["Cities in
Flight"](/2008-04-19-review-cities-in-flight-by-james-blish)), I thought of him
as a long-format author. Now I realize that he actually writes in fairly short
form, and that it took four of his novels to add up to a compilation as long as
single books like "Mockingbird" by Walter Tevis or "Grass" by Sheri S.
Tepper(review coming soon on that one).

"Midsummer Century" is another of these short novels. It's scarcely half
an inch thick, and it flew by almost before I picked it up and started reading.
With a novel this short, it's hard to even give an approximation without
spoiling things. I'll stick to what's on the dust jacket.

Suffice to say this is another in the long tradition of Science Fiction novels
that send a modern man into the future ["Accidental Time
Machine"](/2010-01-08-accidental-time-machine-by-joe-haldeman) by Joe Haldeman,
["Farnham's Freehold"](/2007-12-13-review-farnhams-freehold-by-robert) by Robert
Heinlein and "Word Out of Time" by Larry Niven are good examples). This
variation on a common theme is uniquely Blish.

The main character journeys not in body, but in mind. His struggles in the
new world are largely psychic rather than physical. The ultimate
empowering of the hero comes from visualizing the nature of consciousness and
enlightenment. This visualization is described in loving detail, I think I
spent longer trying to sketch that out than reading the rest of the book.

This is a very short novel, a popcorn kernel with a bit of philosophy inside.
It's not the absolute best of Blish, but it's an incredibly quick read and
still well recommended.
