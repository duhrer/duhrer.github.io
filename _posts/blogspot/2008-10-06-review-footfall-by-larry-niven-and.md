A couple of years ago, a colleague of mine recommended "The Mote in God's Eye"
to me, also by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Since then, I've read and
enjoyed "Oath of Fealty", "Lucifer's Hammer" and "The Burning City" by the same
pair. 

At around the time this book came out, I (as a twelve year old) was a huge fan
of Stephen King, blazing through everything he had published to that point.
Some of his books (notably "The Stand") were long, but all had a fairly simple
vocabulary and cinematic plots. Reading "Footfall", I realized that it had that
same feeling. It's a long, fast run over even terrain, where Banks and Macleod
require slower passage over steeper ground. "Footfall" is also very cinematic.
Each scene comes easily to mind and seems like something that can and should
have been filmed (it would have made a good miniseries, and I swear bits of it
showed up in "Independence Day").

If you've enjoyed "Lucifer's Hammer" or "The Stand" or any other similar bit of
disaster fiction, this book is certainly enjoyable enough. Well worth taking
along to the pub on a rainy Sunday (as I did).
