I just finished "Camouflage", another quick and fun read from Joe Haldeman,
author of "Forever War", ["Accidental Time
Machine"](/2010-01-08-accidental-time-machine-by-joe-haldeman) and
["Marsbound"](/2010-01-17-marsbound-by-joe-haldeman). Joe Haldeman fills his
book with thinking characters, outsiders who succeed because they take leaps of
faith, outwit or just outluck the problems they encounter. His characters are
self-aware, but not navel-gazers by any means. They are pragmatists, survivors,
but also tend to have a sense of humor gained through hard experience in the
absurdities and harshness of life.

The main characters in "Camouflage" are immortal aliens with the ability to
mimic humans. Think of it as "Highlander", but with much less romanticism and
simplicity, and a lot more alienness. They may pretend to be human, but they
are much more than long-lived humans. They can change identities, changing
their apparent age, sex, race not quite as easily as we change clothes, but
easily enough that they can move from life to life, career to career as they
live through our history.

For most of the book we follow the more naive of the two aliens, the changeling,
who has emulated a shark and other sea creatures for millions of years, and one
day emulates the sailors it has seen and wanders ashore. Thus begins its journey
from being only slightly more than animal to being more than human. Although
life is nasty and brutish at times for the changeling, it's not short, and this
makes all the difference. "Camouflage" is one of three books I read during my
trip that deal with the challenges and advantages of a very long life.
Stay tuned for a double-bill comparing "Welcome, Chaos" by Kate Wilhelm
and "Time Enough for Love" by Robert Heinlein.

As with "Accidental Time Traveler" and "Marsbound", this is a short book, a fun
read, and highly recommended.
