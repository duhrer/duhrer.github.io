"Cities in Flight" is a remarkable and epic four-volume cycle of novels that
follow space-faring humans from their first tentative rocket-powered journeys to
the planets of our own solar system to the end of the universe itself. 

The first volume introduces us to a near future which is about to be
revolutionized by two key discoveries that will enable man to venture out into
space en masse. The second volume follows one young man suddenly thrust into
the "Okie" culture in which entire cities fly from planet to planet looking for
work and raw materials (those of you who have read ["Execution Channel" by Ken
MacLeod](/2007-09-20-review-execution-channel-by-ken-macleod) may find this
concept familiar). The third volume follows the decline of the civilization in
which the "Okie" cities operate. The fourth volume continues beyond the decline
of civilization to the end of time itself.

What's impressive is the way in which Blish manages to project his ideas about
the life cycle of cultures and civilizations while still making it clear that
cultures and civilizations are always composed of living, breathing individuals.
In the first volume, there are three key characters who give us a vantage point
to understand the declining western culture and the two key scientific
discoveries that make possible the birth of the new culture of space pioneers.
In the second volume, we follow a young man who is swept up ("press-ganged")
into an "Okie" city, and through him we learn about the emerging "Okie" culture.
Towards the end of the second volume, we are introduced to John Amalfi, the
mayor of the space-faring city of New York, New York, who is the main character
of the third and fourth volumes.

The omnibus edition I read includes an afterword that ties the timeline of the
volumes to historical civilizations and compares them to the "Okie"
civilization. Even without the afterword, this is a well-crafted exploration of
culture and civilization with heavy references to our own Earth-bound history,
and stands the test of time incredibly well. Well worth a read.
