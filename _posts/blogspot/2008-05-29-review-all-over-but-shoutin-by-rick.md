On a recent trip over from the states, my mother brought a copy of "All Over but
the Shoutin'" by Rick Bragg, which I read during my recent holiday.

Rick Bragg is a journalist, a Southerner, and a storyteller. In this book, he
tells his story, his family's story, and with love, respect and regret, his
mother's story. Their stories are closer to my mother's generation and its
experience of the old south and its poverty, but those experiences are still
accessible in a quite personal way for me at a distance.

It was particularly timely to read about Bragg flying his own mother to New York
to watch him receive the Pulitzer Prize while in the midst of our trip around
the UK with my Mom, who had never been outside the states before.

Anyway, I loved the book and highly recommend it.
