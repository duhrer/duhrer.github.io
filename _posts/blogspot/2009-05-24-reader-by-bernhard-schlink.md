On a recent trip, I ran through my own stack of books and borrowed a copy of
"The Reader" by Bernhard Schlink.

To describe the story in too much detail would be to spoil it. In short, this
is a story about a romance (of a sort) set against the backdrop of the
collective societal guilt in Germany following the holocaust. The characters
are believable and human, and the story on the whole is enjoyable. I suppose I
prefer other particular flavors of moral ambiguity a bit better (the film "He
Got Game" by Spike Lee, for example), but on the whole I thought the material
was interesting and well handled.

As with many translated works, it's a little difficult to get into the flow of
the novel, the prose just doesn't sing or grab your attention in quite the same
way. Regardless, it's a very quick read, and worth a look.
