As you may have guessed in reading previous posts, I have a particular affection
for apocalyptic literature. "Earth Abides" is a great apocalyptic tale, in
which hints of "The Stand" and countless later works are apparent. 

The book follows a survivor of a great plague through his life as a young man
until his death as a very old man. Through the course of his life, he learns to
let go of the memory of the civilization that was, and to accept the
civilization that has come to be among the survivors. Along the way come
questions about the relationship of the individual and the state and many other
observations about custom, law, superstition, and our relationship with the
natural world.

This is an earnest book, without the cynicism of work like "Cat's Cradle". It
tackles the material directly, and seems to be honestly considering at each
point what it would be like to rebuild some vestige of society in the wake of
the nearly total extinction of the human species.

At times the situations and tone of the book seem dated, but this is still a
book well worth reading.
