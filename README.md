# My Personal Site

This repository is used to maintain [my personal site on GitHub
Pages](https://duhrer.github.io/). All content is created by me.


## Testing Locally

To test locally, first install all dependencies using a command like:

`bundle install`

Once that completes successfully, you can serve up the content locally using
a command like:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`

## Deploying

To deploy, commit the changes, merge with `main`, and push that upstream.

## The Content Here

The content here is a combination of static content from my old GitHub Pages
site, [my old blog](https://tonyatkins.blogspot.com/), and content created from
my notes on various projects.

The blog content was migrated using
[the Jekyll Blogger importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/), with
light editing to ensure properly working images and links, and to remove various
conversion cruft (like raw HTML instead of markdown).
