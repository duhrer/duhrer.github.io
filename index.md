Welcome to the place where I share my projects, ideas, and sometimes even
professional work. I do my best to [take notes](/blogs) if you want to read
about what I've been up to.

Although a lot of my work requires particular equipment, there are a few
[live demos](./demos) you can try yourself. You can also see demonstrations of
some of my work [on my YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeIdyPg5iTJya2wVFBlKeag).
